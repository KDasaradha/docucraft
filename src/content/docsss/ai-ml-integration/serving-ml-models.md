# 14.1 Serving ML Models with FastAPI

FastAPI is an excellent choice for serving machine learning models due to its high performance and ease of use with Pydantic for data validation.

This section covers:
- Loading pre-trained ML models (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Defining input and output schemas with Pydantic.
- Creating API endpoints for predictions.
- Handling asynchronous model inference.
- Best practices for deploying ML models with FastAPI.
