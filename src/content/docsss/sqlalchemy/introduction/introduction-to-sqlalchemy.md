# 3.1 Introduction to SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

SQLAlchemy is divided into two main components:
- **SQLAlchemy Core:** Provides tools for schema definition, SQL expression language, and connection pooling. It allows you to work with SQL more directly.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM:** Builds upon the Core to provide an object-oriented way to interact with your database, mapping Python classes to database tables and instances of those classes to rows.
