# 1.4 Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key features include:
- **Fast:** Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Fast to code:** Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer bugs:** Reduce about 40% of human-induced errors.
- **Intuitive:** Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy:** Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short:** Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- **Robust:** Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based:** Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
