# Supplementary FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Async Programming Guide

This document supplements the comprehensive guide by adding emerging trends and practical enhancements related to FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and async programming. Each topic includes a description and relevant questions to deepen understanding and application.

## 1. API Versioning in FastAPI

### 1.1 API Versioning Strategies
- **Description**: Implementing API versioning to support backward compatibility and smooth transitions for clients in FastAPI applications.
- **Questions**:
  - Write a FastAPI app with versioned endpoints using path-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`).
  - How do you implement header-based API versioning in FastAPI?
  - What are the pros and cons of path-based vs. header-based versioning in FastAPI?
  - How do you deprecate old API versions in FastAPI while maintaining client support?

## 2. AI and Machine Learning Integration

### 2.1 Serving ML Models with FastAPI
- **Description**: Integrating machine learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) with FastAPI for real-time inference APIs.
- **Questions**:
  - Write a FastAPI endpoint that serves predictions from a pre-trained ML model using ONNX.
  - How do you optimize FastAPI for low-latency ML inference in production?
  - What are the security considerations for exposing ML models via FastAPI APIs?
  - How do you handle batch predictions in an async FastAPI endpoint?

## 3. Serverless Optimizations

### 3.1 Optimizing FastAPI for Serverless
- **Description**: Fine-tuning FastAPI applications for serverless platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to reduce cold start times and improve scalability.
- **Questions**:
  - Write a FastAPI app optimized for AWS Lambda using Mangum as the ASGI adapter.
  - How do you minimize cold start times in a serverless FastAPI deployment?
  - What are the challenges of handling WebSocket connections in serverless FastAPI apps?
  - How do you manage database connections in a serverless FastAPI app?

## 4. Advanced Documentation Practices

### 4.1 Enhanced API Documentation
- **Description**: Using tools like Redoc or custom OpenAPI extensions to create user-friendly and detailed API documentation in FastAPI.
- **Questions**:
  - Write a FastAPI app with custom Redoc documentation and extended OpenAPI descriptions.
  - How do you integrate external markdown files into FastAPIâ€™s OpenAPI documentation?
  - What are the best practices for maintaining API documentation in a large FastAPI project?
  - How do you version API documentation in FastAPI for multiple API versions?

## 5. Data Streaming with Async Generators

### 5.1 Async Data Streaming
- **Description**: Using async generators in FastAPI for efficient streaming of large datasets or real-time data.
- **Questions**:
  - Write a FastAPI endpoint that streams database query results using an async generator.
  - How do async generators improve memory efficiency in FastAPI for large datasets?
  - What are the challenges of handling client disconnections during async streaming?
  - How do you implement backpressure in FastAPI async streaming endpoints?
