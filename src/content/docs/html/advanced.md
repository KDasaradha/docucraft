# HTML - Advanced Topics

Key topics for advanced HTML include:

- Accessibility (ARIA):
    - WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties
    - Making custom components accessible
    - Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Microdata and Structured Data (Schema.org, JSON-LD within `<script>`)
- Web Components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates - conceptual understanding, often implemented with JS)
- The `<template>` and `<slot>` elements
- Canvas API (`<canvas>` element for 2D drawing with JavaScript)
- SVG in HTML (`<svg>` element for vector graphics)
- Responsive Images: `<picture>` element, `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for `<img>`
- Content Security Policy (CSP) via `<meta>` tag
- Performance considerations: `async` and `defer` attributes for `<script>` tags, resource hints (`preload`, `prefetch`)
- HTML parsing and the DOM tree
- Internationalization (i18n) attributes: `lang`, `dir`
- The `dialog` element
