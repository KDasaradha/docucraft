# CSS - Hidden Gems & Lesser-Known Features

Key hidden gems and lesser-known CSS features include:

- `:is()` and `:where()` pseudo-classes for simplifying complex selectors
- `:has()` pseudo-class (the "parent selector")
- `currentColor` keyword for inheriting color values
- `object-fit` and `object-position` for image/video resizing behavior
- `scroll-behavior: smooth;` for native smooth scrolling
- `aspect-ratio` property for maintaining aspect ratios
- `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()` CSS functions for responsive values
- Custom properties with fallback values: `var(--my-var, fallback-value)`
- `calc()` for calculations with mixed units
- `:empty` pseudo-class for selecting elements with no children
- `:target` pseudo-class for styling elements linked by URL fragment
- `pointer-events: none;` to make elements non-interactive
- `shape-outside` for flowing content around custom shapes
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
- `conic-gradient()` for creating pie charts or circular progress bars
- CSS `counter()` and `counters()` for custom list numbering
- `scroll-snap-type` and related properties for scroll snapping
- `text-overflow: ellipsis;` (requires `overflow: hidden;` and `white-space: nowrap;`)
- CSS Toggles (experimental, but a concept for state without JS)
- View Transitions API (JavaScript-driven but heavily involves CSS for animations)
