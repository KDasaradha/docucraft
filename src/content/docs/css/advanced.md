- PostCSS and its plugins (e.g., Autoprefixer)
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- CSS-in-JS solutions (Styled Components, Emotion - understanding the concepts and benefits)
- Advanced Animations and Interactions (complex keyframe animations, sequencing)

- Masking and Clipping (`clip-path`, `mask-image`)
- Custom Fonts in-depth (`@font-face`, font loading strategies, variable fonts)
- Houdini API (conceptual understanding of low-level CSS extensibility)
- Performance Optimization: Reducing CSS file size, critical CSS, avoiding reflows/repaints
- Accessibility (ARIA styling considerations, high contrast modes)
