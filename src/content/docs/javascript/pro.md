# JavaScript - Pro-Level Techniques

Key topics for pro-level JavaScript include:

- In-depth understanding of JavaScript engine optimizations (JIT compilation, hidden classes)
- Writing highly performant and memory-efficient JavaScript
- Building and maintaining large-scale JavaScript applications (architectural patterns)
- Advanced state management techniques
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) with JavaScript frameworks
- Real-time communication (WebSockets, WebRTC)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in detail
- WebAssembly (Wasm) integration
- Advanced browser rendering performance (Critical Rendering Path, minimizing reflows/repaints)
- Contributing to JavaScript specifications (ECMAScript) or major libraries/frameworks
- Building custom JavaScript tooling (linters, bundlers, test runners)
- Complex animation and graphics (Canvas, WebGL)
- Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript for complex problem-solving
