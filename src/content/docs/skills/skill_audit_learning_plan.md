## Summary

- **Strengths**: Strong backend foundation with Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and basic Docker, NGINX, and DevSecOps (Jenkins, SonarQube). Proficient in basic testing (unittest, pytest) and API authentication (JWT RS256).

- **Gaps**: Limited knowledge of advanced Python (OOP, data structures, algorithms, multithreading), FastAPI features (logging, security, rate limiting), Pydantic advanced features, and SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL advanced database operations. No experience with MongoDB/NoSQL, advanced security (OAuth2, CSRF, hashing), microservices, cloud platforms, or real-time systems. Limited CI/CD and DevSecOps tool usage.

- **Next Steps**: Prioritize advanced Python concepts, FastAPI security and real-time features, SQL/NoSQL databases, cloud infrastructure (AWS/Kubernetes), and comprehensive security practices. Adopt DevSecOps tools (Trivy, Dependabot, Aqua) and modern CI/CD pipelines to align with mid-senior role expectations.
