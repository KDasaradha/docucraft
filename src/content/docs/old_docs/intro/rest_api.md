# What is a REST API?

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on HTTP protocols to enable communication between clients and servers. Introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 dissertation, REST emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and a uniform approach to resource manipulation. This section dives into its principles, characteristics, advantages, and practical use cases, with FastAPI examples to bring it to life.

## Principles of REST

REST is defined by six guiding principles (five mandatory, one optional). These ensure REST APIs are consistent and efficient:

### 1. Statelessness
- **Definition**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to process it. The server doesn’t store client state between requests.
- **Implication**: No session data is retained; every call is independent.
- **Example**: A request to `GET /users/1` includes the user ID—no prior context is assumed.

### 2. Client-Server Architecture
- **Definition**: The client (e.g., a browser) and server (e.g., a web service) are separate entities, communicating over a network.
- **Implication**: The client handles the UI, while the server manages data and logic, improving separation of concerns.
- **Example**: A mobile app (client) fetches data from a REST API (server).

### 3. Cacheability
- **Definition**: Responses must indicate whether they can be cached (e.g., via HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`).
- **Implication**: Caching reduces server load and speeds up client access.
- **Example**: A `GET /weather` response might include `Cache-Control: max-age=3600`.

### 4. Layered System
- **Definition**: The architecture can include intermediaries (e.g., proxies, load balancers) without the client knowing.
- **Implication**: Enhances scalability and security (e.g., a CDN caching responses).
- **Example**: A client calls an API, unaware of a reverse proxy handling the request.

### 5. Uniform Interface
- **Definition**: A consistent way to interact with resources using:
  - **Resource Identification**: URLs (e.g., `/users/1`).
  - **Manipulation via Representations**: Data in JSON/XML.
  - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Requests/responses carry metadata (e.g., HTTP methods, status codes).
  - **HATEOAS** (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, optional): Responses include links to related resources.
- **Implication**: Simplifies client development with predictable patterns.

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)
- **Definition**: Servers can send executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to clients.
- **Implication**: Rarely used in REST APIs but allows flexibility.
- **Example**: A server sends a script to render a widget (less common in practice).

## Key Characteristics

- **Statelessness**: No server-side session storage; each request is self-contained.
- **Client-Server**: Clear separation improves modularity.
- **Uniform Interface**: Standardized resource access (e.g., `GET /posts`, `POST /comments`).
- **HTTP-Based**: Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (200, 404, 500).
- **Resource-Oriented**: Everything is a resource with a unique identifier (URL).

---

## Advantages

1. **Scalability**:
   - Statelessness and layered systems allow servers to handle more requests by adding resources (e.g., load balancers).
   - Example: A REST API scales horizontally across multiple servers.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Clients can evolve independently of servers as long as the interface remains consistent.
   - Example: A mobile app updates its UI without changing the API.

3. **Performance**:
   - Cacheability reduces latency; lightweight JSON responses minimize bandwidth.
   - Example: Cached `GET /products` responses speed up e-commerce apps.

Additional benefits include simplicity, wide adoption, and compatibility with web standards.

---

## Common Use Cases

1. **Web Services**:
   - Powering websites with dynamic data (e.g., fetching user profiles).
   - Example: GitHub’s REST API for repository management.

2. **Mobile Applications**:
   - Delivering data to iOS/Android apps (e.g., weather updates).
   - Example: A news app fetching articles via `GET /articles`.

3. **Microservices**:
   - Enabling communication between small, independent services.
   - Example: An e-commerce system with separate APIs for orders, payments, and inventory.

## Code Snippets with FastAPI

FastAPI is a natural fit for REST APIs due to its speed, type safety, and built-in support for HTTP methods. Here are examples illustrating REST principles:

### 1. Basic GET (Statelessness & Uniform Interface)
Fetch a user by ID.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    users = {1: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}}
    return users.get(user_id, {"error": "User not found"})
```

- **Run**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- **Test**: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1` → `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`
- **Principle**: Stateless—each request includes the `user_id`; uniform—uses a clear resource URL.

---

### 2. POST (Resource Creation)
Add a new user.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

users = {}

@app.post("/users/")
def create_user(user: User):
    user_id = len(users) + 1
    users[user_id] = user.dict()
    return {"user_id": user_id, "data": users[user_id]}
```

- **Test**: 
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Bob", "age": 30}'
  # Output: {"user_id": 1, "data": {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}}
  ```
- **Principle**: Uniform interface—`POST` creates a resource; client-server—app sends data, server stores it.

---

### 3. Cacheable Response
Return a cacheable weather forecast.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/weather/")
def get_weather():
    data = {"city": "London", "temp": 15}
    headers = {"Cache-Control": "max-age=3600"}  # Cache for 1 hour
    return JSONResponse(content=data, headers=headers)
```

- **Test**: `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8000/weather/` (check headers)
- **Principle**: Cacheability—clients/proxies can store the response, reducing server load.

---

### 4. HATEOAS (Optional)
Include links in responses.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    user = {1: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}}
    if user_id in user:
        return {
            "data": user[user_id],
            "links": {"self": f"/users/{user_id}", "all_users": "/users/"}
        }
    return {"error": "User not found"}
```

- **Test**: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1`
  ```json
  {"data": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, "links": {"self": "/users/1", "all_users": "/users/"}}
  ```
- **Principle**: HATEOAS—response guides the client to related resources.

---

## REST in Action
Imagine a blog app:
- `GET /posts`: List all posts.
- `POST /posts`: Create a new post.
- `PUT /posts/1`: Update post #1.
- `DELETE /posts/1`: Remove post #1.
FastAPI handles these naturally, aligning with REST’s uniform interface and stateless nature.

---

## Why REST Matters
REST’s simplicity and adherence to web standards make it the go-to choice for modern APIs. With tools like FastAPI, you get automatic documentation (e.g., Swagger UI) and type checking, amplifying REST’s strengths.
