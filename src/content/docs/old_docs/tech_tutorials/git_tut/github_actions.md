### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**, a set of practices and tools that automate the software development lifecycle to improve efficiency, reliability, and speed.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository (e.g., multiple times a day).
  - Automated builds and tests run to catch issues early.
  - Goal: Ensure code is always in a working state.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
  - Extends CI by automatically preparing code for release to production-like environments after passing tests.
  - Requires manual approval to deploy.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  - Fully automates deployment to production after passing all checks, with no manual intervention.
  - Goal: Ship small, frequent updates to users.

**Benefits**:
- Faster releases, reduced errors, improved collaboration, and quicker feedback loops.

### Why We Use GitHub Actions?

**Reasons to Use GitHub Actions**:
- **Native Integration**: Built into GitHub, no external setup needed—workflows live alongside your code.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple YAML-based configuration, accessible to beginners and pros.
- **Event-Driven**: Triggered by GitHub events (e.g., push, pull request), webhooks, or schedules.
- **Community Ecosystem**: Thousands of reusable actions in the GitHub Marketplace.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Linux, Windows, macOS, and self-hosted runners.
- **Free Tier**: Offers 2,000 minutes/month for free accounts (as of March 2025), sufficient for many projects.
- **Flexibility**: Automates CI/CD, testing, deployments, and custom tasks (e.g., issue management).

**Use Case**: Automate testing on every pull request, deploy to production on merge, or publish packages—all from your GitHub repo.

### What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a platform within GitHub that automates workflows for software development. It’s a CI/CD tool but extends beyond that to automate any task tied to your repository.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Workflow**: An automated process defined in a YAML file, consisting of one or more jobs.
  - **Job**: A set of steps executed on a single runner (virtual machine or self-hosted server).
  - **Step**: An individual task within a job—either a shell command or an action.
  - **Action**: A reusable unit of code (e.g., `actions/checkout`) that performs a specific task.
  - **Runner**: The environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`) where jobs execute.
  - **Event**: Triggers a workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).

- **How It Works**:
  - You define workflows in YAML files stored in your repo.
  - Events trigger workflows, which run jobs on runners, executing steps sequentially or in parallel.

- **Example**: A workflow might build your app, run tests, and deploy it when you push code to `main`.

### How Workflows Are Defined and Folder Structure

#### Workflow Definition
- Workflows are written in **YAML** (`.yml` or `.yaml` files) and stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
- Each file represents one workflow, and a repo can have multiple workflows for different purposes (e.g., CI, deployment).

#### Folder Structure
- **Root Directory**: Your project files (e.g., `src/`, `README.md`).
- **`.github/`**: Special directory for GitHub-related configurations.
  - **`workflows/`**: Subdirectory for all workflow YAML files.
    - Example: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
  - Other optional files: `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

**Example Structure**:
```
my-repo/
├── src/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── tests/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   │   ├── build.yml
│   │   └── deploy.yml
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

- **Why This Structure?**: GitHub automatically detects and runs YAML files in `.github/workflows` when triggered by events.

### How to Write Workflow YAML Files

#### Basics of Workflow YAML
- **Syntax**: YAML uses indentation (spaces, not tabs) to define structure.
- **Key Sections**:
  - `name`: Workflow name (appears in GitHub’s Actions tab).
  - `on`: Events that trigger the workflow.
  - `jobs`: Defines tasks to run, each with a unique ID.

#### Writing a Workflow from Scratch
Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create the File**:
   - In your repo, create `.github/workflows/` if it doesn’t exist.
   - Add a file, e.g., `ci.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow**:
   - Start with the basic structure:
     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow
     on: [push]
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - run: echo "Hello, World!"
     ```

3. **Breakdown**:
   - `name: CI Workflow`: Names the workflow for display.
   - `on: [push]`: Triggers on any push to the repo.
   - `jobs`: Contains one job called `build`.
     - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Runs on a fresh Ubuntu VM.
     - `steps`: List of tasks; here, it just prints a message.

4. **Expand with Real Tasks**:
   - Add common steps like checking out code and running a build:
     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v3
             with:
               node-version: '18'
           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install
           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test
     ```

5. **Commit and Push**:
   - Save the file, commit it, and push to GitHub. Check the “Actions” tab to see it run.

### Explanation of the Workflow File

#### Sample Workflow File
```yaml
name: Build and Test
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

#### Detailed Breakdown
1. **`name: Build and Test`**:
   - Descriptive name shown in the GitHub Actions UI.

2. **`on`**:
   - Defines triggers:
     - `push`: Runs when code is pushed.
     - `pull_request`: Runs for PRs.
     - `branches`: Limits triggers to the `main` branch.

3. **`jobs`**:
   - `build`: Job ID (can have multiple jobs, e.g., `test`, `deploy`).
     - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Specifies the runner (GitHub-hosted Ubuntu VM).
     - `steps`: Sequential tasks within the job.

4. **`steps`**:
   - **`- name: Checkout repository`**:
     - `uses: actions/checkout@v4`: Reusable action to clone your repo’s code.
   - **`- name: Setup Python`**:
     - `uses: actions/setup-python@v5`: Sets up Python.
     - `with`: Parameters for the action (e.g., `python-version: '3.11'`).
   - **`- name: Install dependencies`**:
     - `run: pip install -r requirements.txt`: Shell command to install dependencies.
   - **`- name: Run tests`**:
     - `run: pytest`: Runs tests using pytest.

#### Key Terms
- **`uses`**: References a prebuilt action (e.g., from GitHub Marketplace).
- **`run`**: Executes a custom shell command.
- **`with`**: Passes inputs to an action.
- **`env`**: (Optional) Sets environment variables for steps.
- **`if`**: (Optional) Conditionally runs a step (e.g., `if: success()`).

### Writing a Workflow from Scratch: Example

Let’s create a workflow for a Node.js project:

1. **Goal**: Build and test on push to `main`.
2. **Steps**:
   - Checkout code.
   - Set up Node.js.
   - Install dependencies.
   - Run tests.

3. **YAML File** (`ci.yml`):
   ```yaml
   name: Node.js CI
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
   jobs:
     build-and-test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '20'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm ci
         - name: Run lint
           run: npm run lint
         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```

4. **Explanation**:
   - Triggers on push to `main`.
   - Uses `ubuntu-latest` runner.
   - `npm ci` ensures a clean install of dependencies.
   - Runs linting and tests as separate steps.

5. **Testing It**:
   - Commit and push `ci.yml` to `.github/workflows/`.
   - Go to the “Actions” tab in your repo to see the workflow run.

### Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Use `env` to set variables (e.g., `env: NODE_ENV: test`).
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in GitHub Secrets and reference them (e.g., `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`).
- **Matrix Builds**: Test across multiple environments:
  ```yaml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      node-version: [16, 18, 20]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
  ```
- **Caching**: Speed up workflows (e.g., cache `node_modules` with `actions/cache`).
