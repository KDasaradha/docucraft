# Advanced/Pro: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and Automation

## üîπ What to Learn?
This section focuses on automating development workflows using GitHub Actions, building robust CI/CD pipelines, and integrating with cutting-edge infrastructure tools. It assumes familiarity with intermediate Git concepts like branching and collaboration.

---

### ‚úÖ Introduction to GitHub Actions

#### What is GitHub Actions? Why Use It?
- **Definition**: GitHub Actions is a platform for automating workflows directly within GitHub repositories. It enables CI/CD, task automation, and custom event-driven processes.
- **Why Use It?**
  - **Integrated**: Lives in your GitHub repo, no external CI tools needed.
  - **Event-Driven**: Triggered by GitHub events (e.g., push, pull request, issue creation).
  - **Extensible**: Use pre-built ‚Äúactions‚Äù from the GitHub Marketplace or write your own.
  - **Scalable**: Free for public repos, generous limits for private repos.
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, deployment, linting, notifications, and more.

#### Understanding Workflows, Jobs, and Actions
- **Workflow**: A configurable automated process defined in a YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`). It consists of one or more jobs.
- **Job**: A set of steps executed on a single runner (virtual machine). Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.
- **Step**: An individual task within a job (e.g., run a command, use an action).
- **Action**: A reusable unit of code (e.g., `actions/checkout` to clone your repo).
- **Example Structure**:
  ```yaml
  name: CI Workflow
  on: [push]  # Trigger event
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Runner OS
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Action
        - run: echo "Hello, World!"  # Command
  ```

#### Writing a Basic GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File Location**: `.github/workflows/<name>.yml`.
- **Basic Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: Basic CI
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
    pull_request:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with:
            python-version: '3.9'
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: Run tests
          run: pytest
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - Triggers on `push` or `pull_request` to `main`.
  - Runs a job called `test` on an Ubuntu VM.
  - Checks out code, sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

### ‚úÖ Automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions

#### Running Tests Automatically on Every Push
- **Goal**: Ensure code quality by running tests on every commit.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: Test Suite
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with: python-version: '3.9'
        - run: pip install pytest
        - run: pytest --verbose
  ```

#### Setting Up FastAPI + PostgreSQL CI/CD Pipeline
- **Goal**: Test a FastAPI app with a PostgreSQL database and deploy it.
- **Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  name: FastAPI CI/CD
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      services:
        postgres:
          image: postgres:latest
          env:
            POSTGRES_USER: testuser
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testpass
            POSTGRES_DB: testdb
          ports:
            - 5432:5432
          options: >-
            --health-cmd pg_isready
            --health-interval 10s
            --health-timeout 5s
            --health-retries 5
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with: python-version: '3.9'
        - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: Run migrations
          run: alembic upgrade head
          env:
            DATABASE_URL: postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb
        - name: Run tests
          run: pytest
    deploy:
      needs: test  # Runs after test job succeeds
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Deploy to Server
          run: ssh user@server "cd /app && git pull && systemctl restart fastapi"
  ```
- **Key Points**:
  - `services`: Spins up a PostgreSQL container for testing.
  - `needs`: Ensures deployment only happens after tests pass.

#### Deploying Docker Containers Using GitHub Actions
- **Goal**: Build, push, and deploy a Dockerized FastAPI app.
- **Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  name: Docker Deploy
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    build-and-deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Set up Docker Buildx
          uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
        - name: Login to Docker Hub
          uses: docker/login-action@v2
          with:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
        - name: Build and Push Docker Image
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
          with:
            context: .
            push: true
            tags: username/fastapi-app:latest
        - name: Deploy to Server
          run: |
            ssh user@server << 'EOF'
              docker pull username/fastapi-app:latest
              docker stop fastapi-app || true
              docker run -d --rm -p 8000:8000 --name fastapi-app username/fastapi-app:latest
            EOF
  ```
- **Dockerfile Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.9-slim
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY . .
  CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
  ```

### ‚úÖ Advanced GitHub Actions Concepts

#### Using Secrets & Environment Variables
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in GitHub Settings > Secrets.
  - Example: Add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.
  - Access: `${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}`.
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      env:
        APP_ENV: production
      steps:
        - run: echo "Running in $APP_ENV"
  ```

#### Matrix Builds for Different OS/Versions
- **Goal**: Test across multiple environments.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: Matrix Test
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
          python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10']
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
          with:
            python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        - run: pytest
  ```

#### Caching Dependencies to Speed Up Builds
- **Goal**: Avoid re-downloading dependencies.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Cache Python dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### Running Jobs Conditionally
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    deploy:
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Only run on main
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "Deploying..."
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Security & Best Practices

#### Using Dependabot for Dependency Updates
- **Setup**: Add `.github/dependabot.yml`:
  ```yaml
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "pip"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
  ```
- **Result**: PRs for outdated dependencies.

#### Restricting Access with Branch Protection Rules
- **Setup**: Settings > Branches > Add Rule:
  - Protect `main`.
  - Enable ‚ÄúRequire pull request reviews‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequire status checks.‚Äù

#### Secure API Keys Using GitHub Secrets
- **Best Practice**: Never hardcode keys; use `${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}` in workflows.

---

### ‚úÖ Integrating GitHub Actions with Kubernetes & Terraform

#### Deploying FastAPI Microservices to Kubernetes
- **Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy to Kubernetes
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Set up kubectl
          uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
          with:
            version: 'latest'
        - name: Configure Kubeconfig
          run: |
            echo "${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}" > kubeconfig
            export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig
        - name: Deploy
          run: kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  ```
- **k8s/deployment.yaml**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: fastapi-app
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: fastapi
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: fastapi
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: fastapi
          image: username/fastapi-app:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8000
  ```

#### Automating Terraform Infrastructure Deployment
- **Workflow**:
  ```yaml
  name: Terraform Deploy
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    infra:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Setup Terraform
          uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
          with:
            terraform_version: 1.5.0
        - name: Terraform Init
          run: terraform init
          env:
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        - name: Terraform Apply
          run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```
- **main.tf Example**:
  ```hcl
  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "my-fastapi-bucket"
  }
  ```

# Advanced/Pro: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and Automation (Expanded)

---

## ‚úÖ Introduction to GitHub Actions (Expanded)

### Advanced Workflow Triggers
- **Custom Events**:
  - Trigger workflows on custom repository events:
    ```yaml
    on:
      repository_dispatch:
        types: [deploy-now]
    ```
    - Trigger via API: `curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" -d '{"event_type": "deploy-now"}' https://api.github.com/repos/username/repo/dispatches`.
- **Scheduled Runs**:
  - Use cron syntax for periodic tasks:
    ```yaml
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight UTC
    ```
- **Workflow Inputs**:
  - Allow manual triggering with inputs:
    ```yaml
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
          environment:
            description: 'Choose environment'
            required: true
            default: 'staging'
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
    ```

### Self-Hosted Runners
- **Why Use?**: Run workflows on your own hardware for faster builds, custom environments, or private networks.
- **Setup**:
  1. Settings > Actions > Runners > Add Runner.
  2. Follow instructions to install on your machine.
  3. Use in workflow: `runs-on: self-hosted`.
- **Labels**: Assign custom labels (e.g., `gpu-runner`) and target them:
  ```yaml
  runs-on: [self-hosted, gpu-runner]
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions (Expanded)

### Multi-Stage CI/CD Pipeline
- **Example**: Build, test, deploy with staging and production stages.
  ```yaml
  name: Multi-Stage CI/CD
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
        - run: docker save -o myapp.tar myapp:latest
        - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: docker-image
            path: myapp.tar
    test:
      needs: build
 memos:      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: docker-image
            path: .
        - run: docker load -i myapp.tar
        - run: docker run myapp:latest pytest
    deploy-staging:
      needs: test
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: docker-image
        - run: docker load -i myapp.tar
        - run: docker tag myapp:latest myregistry/staging:myapp
        - run: docker push myregistry/staging:myapp
    deploy-production:
      needs: deploy-staging
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: docker-image
        - run: docker load -i myapp.tar
        - run: docker tag myapp:latest myregistry/prod:myapp
        - run: docker push myregistry/prod:myapp
  ```
- **Artifacts**: Share Docker images between jobs using `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact`.

### Dynamic Environment Deployments
- **Goal**: Deploy to different environments based on branch or tag.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: Dynamic Deploy
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, staging]
      tags: ['v*']
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Determine Environment
          id: env
          run: |
            if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
              echo "env=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            elif [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/staging" ]]; then
              echo "env=staging" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            elif [[ "${{ github.ref }}" =~ ^refs/tags/v.* ]]; then
              echo "env=release" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            fi
        - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ steps.env.outputs.env }}"
  ```

## ‚úÖ Advanced GitHub Actions Concepts (Expanded)

### Reusable Workflows
- **Purpose**: Define workflows once and reuse across repos.
- **Example**:
  - `.github/workflows/reusable.yml`:
    ```yaml
    name: Reusable Test Workflow
    on:
      workflow_call:
        inputs:
          python-version:
            required: true
            type: string
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
              python-version: ${{ inputs.python-version }}
          - run: pytest
    ```
  - Call it:
    ```yaml
    name: CI
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      call-test:
        uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
    ```

### Custom Actions
- **Types**:
  - **JavaScript**: Use Node.js for logic.
  - **Docker**: Container-based actions.
- **Docker Action Example**:
  - `.github/actions/my-action/Dockerfile`:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM alpine:latest
    COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
    RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
    ```
  - `.github/actions/my-action/entrypoint.sh`:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello from custom action!"
    ```
  - `.github/actions/my-action/action.yml`:
    ```yaml
    name: My Custom Action
    description: A simple custom action
    runs:
      using: docker
      image: Dockerfile
    ```
  - Use: `uses: ./.github/actions/my-action`.

### Parallel Jobs with Dependency Graphs
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    lint:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps: [ ... ]
    test-unit:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps: [ ... ]
    test-integration:
      needs: [lint, test-unit]
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps: [ ... ]
    deploy:
      needs: test-integration
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps: [ ... ]
  ```
- **Optimization**: Run independent jobs (e.g., lint, unit tests) in parallel.

## ‚úÖ Security & Best Practices (Expanded)

### Advanced Secret Management
- **Encrypted Secrets with OIDC**:
  - Use GitHub‚Äôs OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate with cloud providers (e.g., AWS) without long-lived credentials.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      deploy:
        permissions:
          id-token: write
          contents: read
        steps:
          - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
            with:
              role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-role
              aws-region: us-east-1
    ```

### Audit Workflows
- **Security Scanning**:
  - Add CodeQL for code analysis:
    ```yaml
    name: CodeQL Analysis
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      analyze:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
            with:
              languages: python
          - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
    ```

### Rate Limiting and Quotas
- **Mitigation**: Use `concurrency` to limit parallel runs:
  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Integrating GitHub Actions with Kubernetes & Terraform (Expanded)

### Kubernetes Rolling Updates
- **Goal**: Perform zero-downtime deployments.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
