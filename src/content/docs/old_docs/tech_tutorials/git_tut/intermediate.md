# Intermediate: Branching, Merging, and Collaboration

## üîπ What to Learn?
This section dives deeper into Git‚Äôs powerful features for managing complex projects, collaborating with teams, and handling versioning. It assumes you‚Äôre comfortable with basic Git commands like `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.

---

### ‚úÖ Git Branching & Merging

#### `git branch <branch_name>` ‚Üí Create a New Branch
- **Purpose**: Creates an isolated line of development to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- **How it Works**: A branch is a pointer to a commit. The `main` branch is typically the default.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git branch feature-login
  git branch  # List all branches (* indicates current branch)
  ```
- **Note**: Creating a branch doesn‚Äôt switch to it.

#### `git checkout <branch_name>` ‚Üí Switch Branches
- **Purpose**: Changes your working directory to the specified branch.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git checkout feature-login
  ```
- **Shorthand**: Combine creation and switching with:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-login
  ```

#### `git merge <branch_name>` ‚Üí Merge Branches
- **Purpose**: Combines changes from one branch into another (e.g., merge `feature-login` into `main`).
- **Types of Merges**:
  - **Fast-Forward**: If no divergent changes, Git moves the pointer forward.
  - **Three-Way Merge**: If branches diverge, Git creates a merge commit.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge feature-login
  ```
- **Output**: 
  - Fast-forward: `Fast-forwarded main to <commit-id>.`
  - Merge commit: Opens an editor for a merge message (e.g., "Merge branch 'feature-login'").

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts Manually
- **What Happens**: Conflicts occur when the same part of a file is modified differently in two branches.
- **Steps to Resolve**:
  1. Run `git merge <branch_name>` and see a conflict message.
  2. Open the conflicting file(s). Git marks conflicts with:
     ```text
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Your changes
     =======
     Changes from the other branch
     >>>>>>> feature-login
     ```
  3. Edit the file to keep the desired changes.
  4. Stage and commit:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit  # No -m needed; uses default merge message
     ```
- **Example**:
  - Conflict in `app.py`, resolve it, then:
    ```bash
    git add app.py
    git commit
    ```

---

### ‚úÖ Git Rebase & Cherry-pick

#### `git rebase main` ‚Üí Rebasing vs. Merging
- **Purpose**: Moves your branch‚Äôs commits onto the tip of another branch, creating a linear history (unlike merging‚Äôs merge commits).
- **Rebase vs. Merge**:
  - **Merge**: Preserves history with merge commits, good for collaboration.
  - **Rebase**: Cleaner, linear history, ideal for local feature branches.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git checkout feature-login
  git rebase main
  ```
  - If `main` has new commits, `feature-login`‚Äôs commits are replayed on top.
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  1. If conflicts occur, Git pauses: `git rebase --continue` after resolving, or `git rebase --abort` to cancel.
- **Caution**: Don‚Äôt rebase shared branches (e.g., `main`) as it rewrites history.

#### `git cherry-pick <commit_id>` ‚Üí Applying Specific Commits
- **Purpose**: Copies a specific commit from one branch to your current branch.
- **Use Case**: Bring a bug fix or feature from another branch without merging everything.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git log feature-login --oneline  # Find commit ID (e.g., abc123)
  git cherry-pick abc123
  ```
- **Result**: The commit `abc123` is applied to `main`.

---

### ‚úÖ Collaborating with Teams

#### Pull Requests (PRs) and Code Reviews
- **What‚Äôs a PR?**: A GitHub feature to propose and review changes before merging into a base branch (e.g., `main`).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Push a branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-login
     ```
  2. On GitHub, click **Compare & Pull Request**.
  3. Add a title, description, and reviewers.
  4. Team reviews code, suggests changes, and approves.
  5. Merge the PR (e.g., via ‚ÄúMerge pull request‚Äù button).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Small, focused PRs.
  - Clear descriptions and context.

#### Using GitHub Issues and Projects
- **Issues**: Track bugs, tasks, or feature requests.
  - Create: Go to **Issues** > **New Issue**.
  - Link to PR: Use keywords like ‚ÄúFixes #123‚Äù in PR description.
- **Projects**: Kanban-style boards to organize tasks.
  - Create: **Projects** > **New Project** > Add issues or PRs.

#### Protecting Branches & Enforcing PR Reviews
- **Purpose**: Prevent direct pushes to critical branches (e.g., `main`) and ensure quality.
- **Setup**:
  1. Go to repo **Settings** > **Branches** > **Add Rule**.
  2. Enter branch name (e.g., `main`).
  3. Enable:
     - ‚ÄúRequire pull request reviews before merging.‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúRequire status checks to pass‚Äù (e.g., CI tests).
  4. Save.
- **Result**: Only approved PRs can modify `main`.

---

### ‚úÖ Undoing Changes & Fixing Mistakes

#### `git reset --soft HEAD~1` ‚Üí Undo Last Commit (Keep Changes)
- **Purpose**: Removes the last commit but keeps changes in the staging area.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
- **Use Case**: Fix a commit message or add more changes.

#### `git reset --hard HEAD~1` ‚Üí Undo Last Commit (Discard Changes)
- **Purpose**: Deletes the last commit and its changes entirely.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```
- **Caution**: Irreversible unless previously pushed.

#### `git revert <commit_id>` ‚Üí Revert Specific Commit
- **Purpose**: Creates a new commit that undoes a specific commit, preserving history.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git revert abc123
  ```
- **Use Case**: Safely undo a commit in a shared branch.

---

### ‚úÖ Git Tags & Releases

#### Creating Versioned Releases (`git tag v1.0.0`)
- **Purpose**: Marks a specific commit as a release (e.g., a stable version).
- **Types**:
  - Lightweight: `git tag v1.0.0`
  - Annotated (recommended): `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
  git tag  # List tags
  ```

#### Pushing Tags to GitHub (`git push --tags`)
- **Purpose**: Uploads tags to the remote repository.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git push origin v1.0.0  # Push specific tag
  git push --tags         # Push all tags
  ```
- **GitHub Releases**: On GitHub, go to **Releases** > **Draft a new release**, select a tag, and add notes.

### ‚úÖ Hands-on Projects

#### Project: Set Up Feature Branches for a FastAPI Microservices Project
1. **Initialize Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir fastapi-microservices
   cd fastapi-microservices
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/fastapi-microservices.git
   ```
2. **Create Main App**:
   - `main.py`:
     ```python
     from fastapi import FastAPI
     app = FastAPI()
     @app.get("/")
     def read_root():
         return {"message": "Microservices root"}
     ```
   - Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git push -u origin main`
3. **Feature Branches**:
   - Authentication:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b auth-service
     # Add auth endpoint to main.py
     git add . && git commit -m "Add auth endpoint"
     git push origin auth-service
     ```
   - Payments:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b payment-service
     # Add payment endpoint
     git add . && git commit -m "Add payment endpoint"
     git push origin payment-service
     ```

#### Practice Rebase, Cherry-pick, and Fixing Merge Conflicts
1. **Rebase Example**:
   - Update `main` with a new commit, then:
     ```bash
     git checkout auth-service
     git rebase main
     # Resolve conflicts if any, then git rebase --continue
     ```
2. **Cherry-pick Example**:
   - Cherry-pick a payment fix into `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git cherry-pick <commit-id-from-payment-service>
     ```
3. **Merge Conflict Practice**:
   - Modify `main.py` in both `main` and `auth-service` (same line), then:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge auth-service
     # Resolve conflict, then commit
     ```

---

## Additional Tips
- **Stashing**: Save uncommitted changes temporarily with `git stash`, apply later with `git stash pop`.
- **Interactive Rebase**: `git rebase -i HEAD~3` to edit, squash, or reorder commits.
- **Collaboration Etiquette**: Communicate with your team about branch naming and PR expectations.

Yes, there‚Äôs certainly more to explore in the realm of intermediate Git and GitHub usage! Your outline already covers a solid foundation for branching, merging, and collaboration, but Git is a deep tool with additional features and workflows that can enhance your skills further at this level. Below, I‚Äôll expand on the intermediate topics with additional concepts, techniques, and practical applications that build on what we‚Äôve already covered. I‚Äôll also refine some areas with more depth and include advanced intermediate topics you might find valuable.

## ‚úÖ Git Branching & Merging (Expanded)

### Advanced Branch Management
- **`git branch -d <branch_name>` ‚Üí Delete a Branch**:
  - Deletes a branch after merging: `git branch -d feature-login`.
  - Force delete (unmerged branch): `git branch -D feature-login`.
- **`git branch --move` ‚Üí Rename a Branch**:
  - Example: `git branch -m old-name new-name`.
  - Push renamed branch: `git push origin :old-name new-name`.

### Merge Strategies
- **Explicit Merge Options**:
  - `--no-ff` (No Fast-Forward): Forces a merge commit even if fast-forward is possible.
    ```bash
    git merge --no-ff feature-login
    ```
    - Use Case: Preserve branch history for clarity.
  - `--squash`: Combines all branch commits into one before merging.
    ```bash
    git merge --squash feature-login
    git commit -m "Squash feature-login into one commit"
    ```
- **Visualizing Merges**:
  - Use `git log --graph --oneline --all` to see a graphical representation of branches and merges.

### Handling Complex Merge Conflicts
- **Merge Tools**: Use tools like `git mergetool` to resolve conflicts visually (e.g., with Meld, KDiff3).
  - Setup: `git config --global merge.tool meld`.
  - Run: `git mergetool` during a conflict.
- **Conflict Markers Deep Dive**:
  - Beyond basic resolution, understand `ours` vs. `theirs`:
    - `git checkout --ours <file>`: Keep your branch‚Äôs version.
    - `git checkout --theirs <file>`: Take the incoming branch‚Äôs version.

## ‚úÖ Git Rebase & Cherry-pick (Expanded)

### Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)
- **Purpose**: Rewrite commit history by editing, squashing, or reordering commits.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Edit last 3 commits
  ```
  - Options in the editor:
    - `pick`: Keep commit as-is.
    - `reword`: Edit commit message.
    - `squash`: Combine with previous commit.
    - `drop`: Remove commit.
- **Use Case**: Clean up messy commit history before a PR.

### Rebase with Remote Branches
- **Rebasing Against a Remote**:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```
  - Push after rebasing (force required): `git push --force-with-lease` (safer than `--force`).
- **Caution**: Avoid rebasing shared branches unless coordinated with the team.

### Advanced Cherry-pick
- **Cherry-pick Multiple Commits**:
  ```bash
  git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3
  ```
- **Cherry-pick a Range**:
  ```bash
  git cherry-pick commitA^..commitB  # From A (exclusive) to B (inclusive)
  ```
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Cherry-picking can cause conflicts; resolve similarly to merges, then `git cherry-pick --continue`.

## ‚úÖ Collaborating with Teams (Expanded)

### Workflows Beyond Pull Requests
- **Git Flow**:
  - A popular branching strategy:
    - `main`: Production-ready code.
    - `develop`: Integration branch for features.
    - Feature branches: `feature/*` for new work.
    - Release branches: `release/v1.0.0` for preparing releases.
    - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/*` for urgent fixes.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/user-auth develop
    # Work, commit, push, PR into develop
    ```
- **Forking Workflow**:
  - Common in open-source:
    1. Fork repo.
    2. Clone your fork.
    3. Sync with upstream: `git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>`; `git fetch upstream`.
    4. PR from your fork to upstream.

### GitHub Collaboration Features
- **Codeowners**:
  - Define who reviews specific files in a `CODEOWNERS` file (e.g., in `.github/`).
    ```text
    *.py @username  # Python files reviewed by username
    ```
- **Draft Pull Requests**:
  - Mark PRs as ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù on GitHub to indicate they‚Äôre not ready for review.
- **Branch Protection Rules (Advanced)**:
  - Require signed commits or specific reviewers.
  - Example: ‚ÄúRequire 2 approvals‚Äù for `main`.

### Team Communication
- **Commit Message Conventions**:
  - Use prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` (e.g., `feat: add user login`).
  - Helps with automated changelogs (e.g., via tools like `standard-version`).
- **Slack/Email Integration**: Connect GitHub to team tools for PR/issue notifications.

## ‚úÖ Undoing Changes & Fixing Mistakes (Expanded)

### More Undo Options
- **`git reflog` ‚Üí Recover Lost Commits**:
  - Shows a log of all reference updates (even deleted commits).
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git reflog  # Find commit ID (e.g., abc123)
    git reset --hard abc123  # Restore to that state
    ```
  - Time Limit: Entries expire after ~30 days.
- **`git restore` ‚Üí Granular Undo**:
  - Unstage: `git restore --staged <file>`.
  - Discard changes: `git restore <file>`.

### Fixing Pushed Commits
- **Amend Last Commit**:
  ```bash
  git commit --amend -m "New message"
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```
- **Revert a Pushed Merge**:
  ```bash
  git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-id>
  ```
  - `-m 1` specifies the parent to revert to (usually the main branch).

---

## ‚úÖ Git Tags & Releases (Expanded)

### Lightweight vs. Annotated Tags
- **Lightweight**: Just a pointer to a commit (`git tag v1.0.0`).
- **Annotated**: Includes metadata (author, date, message).
  - Example: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`.
- **View Tags**: `git show v1.0.0` (annotated tags show details).

### Managing Releases on GitHub
- **Pre-releases**: Mark as ‚Äúpre-release‚Äù for beta versions.
- **Assets**: Attach binaries or docs to a release (e.g., `.zip` of your app).
- **Automation**: Use GitHub Actions to auto-generate releases on tag push.

---

## ‚úÖ Additional Intermediate Topics

### Git Stash
- **Purpose**: Temporarily save uncommitted changes to switch branches.
- **Commands**:
  - Save: `git stash push -m "WIP on feature"`.
  - List: `git stash list`.
  - Apply: `git stash pop` (applies and removes) or `git stash apply` (keeps in stash).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  git stash push -m "Half-done feature"
  git checkout main
  # Later...
  git checkout feature-login
  git stash pop
  ```

### Git Bisect
- **Purpose**: Find the commit that introduced a bug using binary search.
- **Steps**:
  ```bash
  git bisect start
  git bisect bad  # Current state is broken
  git bisect good <commit-id>  # Known good commit
  ```
  - Git checks out commits; mark them `good` or `bad` until the culprit is found.
  - End: `git bisect reset`.

### Git Hooks
- **Purpose**: Automate tasks (e.g., linting before commit).
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/` (e.g., `pre-commit`).
- **Example**:
  - Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Running lint..."
    pylint *.py || exit 1
    ```
  - Make executable: `chmod +x pre-commit`.

## ‚úÖ Hands-on Projects (Expanded)

### Enhanced FastAPI Microservices Project
1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Base: `develop` branch for integration.
   - Feature: `feature/auth-service`, `feature/payment-service`.
   - Hotfix: `hotfix/fix-auth-bug` on `main`.
2. **Practice Advanced Techniques**:
   - Squash commits:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/auth-service
     git rebase -i develop
     # Squash commits, then push
     ```
   - Bisect a bug:
     - Introduce a bug in `payment-service`, then use `git bisect` to find it.
3. **Collaboration Simulation**:
   - Protect `main` on GitHub.
   - Create a PR from `feature/auth-service` to `develop`, enforce a review.

### Open-Source Contribution
- Fork a real repo (e.g., a Python library).
- Use `git stash` to switch between tasks, `git rebase` to sync with upstream, and submit a PR with a clear commit history.
