# FastAPI Guidelines

# FastAPI Guide

Welcome to the **FastAPI Guide**, your go-to resource for mastering FastAPI—a modern, high-performance Python framework for building APIs. Whether you're new to API development or an experienced coder, this guide offers step-by-step insights into FastAPI, database integration, best practices, and advanced optimization techniques.

## What You’ll Learn

This guide is organized into sections covering key FastAPI topics:

### 🚀 **Introduction to APIs and FastAPI**
- What are APIs? Understanding types and use cases
- REST API essentials: Principles and design
- FastAPI overview: Features, advantages, and limitations

### 📝 **FastAPI Code Examples**
- Building your first FastAPI app
- Using an in-memory dictionary for quick data storage
- Connecting FastAPI to databases with raw SQL
- Simplifying code with minimal boilerplate

### 🛠 **Database Handling with SQLAlchemy**
- Introduction to SQLAlchemy and ORM concepts
- Integrating SQLAlchemy with FastAPI (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Best practices for seamless database integration
- Pydantic basics and its synergy with FastAPI
- Combining Pydantic and SQLAlchemy for robust validation

### ⚡ **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Processing**
- Sync vs. async: Key differences and when to use each
- Database connections: Sync and async approaches
- Managing sessions and engines effectively

### 📂 **Database Table Creation & Best Practices**
- Table creation methods in SQLAlchemy
- Secure, efficient, and scalable table design

### 🔥 **Naming Conventions & Best Practices**
- Structuring FastAPI projects for clarity
- Naming APIs, routes, functions, and files consistently
- Python naming standards for variables and classes

### 🔧 **Advanced FastAPI Features & Optimization**
- Leveraging Pydantic settings for configuration
- Handling requests: Body, headers, paths, and queries
- Crafting responses: Input/output management
- Boosting performance, reducing latency, and enhancing security

## 🚀 Writing Efficient FastAPI Code
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for sync and async code
- **CRUD Example**: Build a full app with Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **Sync vs. Async CRUD**: Implement the same app in both styles

## 🛠 FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy Toolkit
- **Core Functions & Classes**: Must-know utilities for development
- **Code Snippets**: Practical examples for everyday tasks

## 🌐 Web Server Options
- **Gunicorn, Uvicorn, Hypercorn**: Compare features and use cases
- Recommendations for production and development

## 🔄 Database Queries (Sync vs. Async)
- **Single Table Inserts**: Step-by-step sync and async examples
- **Unrelated Tables**: Handling two or more independent tables
- **Related Tables**: Managing foreign keys and relationships
- **Complex Scenarios**: Inserting into multiple related/unrelated tables

## 📊 Fetching Data (Sync vs. Async)
- **Single Table Queries**: Simple retrieval techniques
- **Unrelated Tables**: Fetching from independent datasets
- **Related Tables**: Querying with relationships
- **Multi-Table Queries**: Strategies for complex data retrieval

## 🏛 Advanced SQLAlchemy Operations
- Functions, views, triggers, and materialized views with SQLAlchemy
- Moving beyond raw SQL for cleaner code

## 🚀 Advanced FastAPI Topics
- Preview of deeper concepts (e.g., middleware, dependency injection)
- Suggestions for further exploration

## 🔗 WebSockets in FastAPI
- **WebSockets 101**: Real-time communication basics
- **Implementation**: Adding WebSockets to FastAPI (sync or async?)

## 🔒 API Security
