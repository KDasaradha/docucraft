As a beginner in DevOps, it’s essential to focus on a manageable set of foundational tools and concepts, building your skills progressively. Trying to learn everything at once (Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.) can be overwhelming. Instead, I’ll provide a structured learning path with a prioritized list of tools, an order to learn them, and explanations of why they matter. This path starts with the basics and gradually moves to intermediate and advanced tools, tailored for a beginner starting from scratch as of March 14, 2025.
