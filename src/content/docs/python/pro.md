- Writing efficient and idiomatic Python (Pythonic code)
- Security Best Practices in Python
- Building and Maintaining Large-Scale Python Applications
- Advanced Debugging Techniques
- Using and creating C extensions for performance-critical code
- Effective use of Python in specific domains (e.g., data science, web development, DevOps)
- Contributing to open-source Python projects
- Writing robust and maintainable APIs
- Architectural patterns for complex systems
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for Python projects
