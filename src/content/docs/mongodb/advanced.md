    - Analyzing `explain()` output thoroughly
    - Profiling database operations
    - Optimizing queries and indexes
    - Hardware considerations
- Backup and Restore Strategies (mongodump, mongorestore, filesystem snapshots)
- Security Best Practices: Network security, encryption at rest, auditing
- Advanced Aggregation Framework:
    - `$lookup` (left outer join)
    - `$graphLookup` (recursive search)
    - Window functions (MongoDB 5.0+)
    - Custom JavaScript functions in aggregation (use with caution)
