DocuCraft is a **modern, lightweight, and highly customizable** static site generator designed for developers. It aims to provide a clean, readable, and intuitive experience for both creating and consuming documentation.

## Key Features

- **Markdown-based**: Content is written in familiar GitHub-Flavored Markdown.
- **Clean UI/UX**: Minimalist design with a focus on readability and developer experience.
- **Customizable**: Flexible theming (light/dark modes) and configurable navigation.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code blocks with support for numerous languages.
- **Intelligent Search**: Quickly find what you're looking for.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices.

## Why DocuCraft?

Existing tools like Docusaurus or Nextra are powerful, but can sometimes feel heavy or lack specific customization options that developers need. DocuCraft strives to be a "better" alternative by focusing on:

1.  **Developer-Friendly Documentation**: Making it easy to write and maintain.
2.  **High Readability**: Ensuring content is pleasant to read.
3.  **Extensibility**: Allowing for custom plugins and integrations.

## Getting Started

To get started with DocuCraft, check out the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide.

```typescript
// This is a TypeScript code block
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```python
# This is a Python code block
def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add(5, 3))
```

This is some `inline code` example.
And a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub Item A
  - Sub Item B
- Item 3
