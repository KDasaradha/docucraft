# React - Intermediate Concepts

Key topics for intermediate React include:

- Hooks in-depth:
    - `useEffect` for side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM changes)
    - `useContext` for state management across components
    - `useReducer` for complex state logic
    - `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance optimization
    - `useRef` for accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values
    - Custom Hooks for reusable logic
- Component Lifecycle (for class components, and understanding effects for functional components)
- State Management:
    - Prop drilling and its downsides
    - Context API for global state
    - Introduction to state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai - concepts)
- Routing: Client-side routing with React Router (or similar)
- Advanced Forms: Form validation, libraries like React Hook Form or Formik
- Styling in React: CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS with React
- Error Boundaries for catching errors in component tree
- Portals for rendering components outside the parent DOM hierarchy
- Higher-Order Components (HOCs) - concept and usage
- Render Props - concept and usage
