## 🧭 How the Quest System Works

The quest system is designed to provide a structured, gamified learning experience:

1. **Progressive Difficulty** - Each quest builds upon the skills and knowledge gained in previous quests
2. **Practical Application** - All quests involve building real components or features
3. **Clear Objectives** - Each quest has specific goals and requirements to meet
4. **Skill Advancement** - Completing quests advances your skills in specific technology areas
5. **Achievement System** - Track your progress and earn recognition for completed quests

## 💡 Quest Structure

Each quest follows a consistent structure:
