# Data Modeling with SQLAlchemy

This section focuses on how to define your database schema and relationships using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapper).

- [Table Creation Methods](./table-creation-methods.md): Explore different ways to define your database tables, including the common Declarative system and the more explicit Imperative mapping.
- [Utilizing Declarative Base Effectively](./declarative-base-usage.md): Learn best practices for using `DeclarativeBase`, such as employing mixins for shared columns and structuring model inheritance.

Proper data modeling is foundational to building robust and maintainable applications with SQLAlchemy.

# SQLAlchemy Modeling

This section delves into the art of defining your data structures using SQLAlchemy's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Effective modeling is crucial for a well-structured and maintainable database layer.

Key topics include:

-   **Table Creation Methods**: Understanding how to define database tables, primarily using the Declarative system but also touching upon Core `Table` objects.
-   **Utilizing Declarative Base Effectively**: Best practices for using `DeclarativeBase` (or the older `declarative_base()`) to define your ORM models, including inheritance patterns and mixins.
-   **Defining Columns and Data Types**: Choosing appropriate SQLAlchemy data types that map to your database's types, and configuring column properties like primary keys, foreign keys, nullability, and constraints.
-   **Establishing Relationships**: Defining one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between your models using `relationship()`, and configuring aspects like `back_populates`, `lazy` loading, and join conditions.
-   **Constraints and Indexes**: Implementing database constraints (unique, check) and indexes through SQLAlchemy model definitions to ensure data integrity and query performance.

Mastering these modeling techniques will enable you to accurately represent your application's data domain within your database using SQLAlchemy.
