# Data Modeling with SQLAlchemy

This section focuses on how to define your database schema and relationships using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapper).

- [Table Creation Methods](./table-creation-methods.md): Explore different ways to define your database tables, including the common Declarative system and the more explicit Imperative mapping.
- [Utilizing Declarative Base Effectively](./declarative-base-usage.md): Learn best practices for using `DeclarativeBase`, such as employing mixins for shared columns and structuring model inheritance.

Proper data modeling is foundational to building robust and maintainable applications with SQLAlchemy.
