# Asynchronous SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy provides robust support for asynchronous programming, allowing you to build non-blocking database interactions, especially useful with frameworks like FastAPI.

Leveraging async SQLAlchemy can significantly improve the concurrency and performance of I/O-bound database operations in your Python applications.
