# 3.4 SQLAlchemy Best Practices

Adhering to best practices when using SQLAlchemy can lead to more maintainable, performant, and robust applications. Here are some general guidelines:

1.  **Session Management**:
    *   Use a session per request (or per unit of work). In web applications like FastAPI, this is often managed via a dependency.
    *   Ensure sessions are always closed, even if errors occur (e.g., using `try...finally` blocks).
    *   Avoid long-lived sessions as they can consume resources and lead to stale data.

2.  **Querying**:
    *   Be explicit with what you load. Use options like `joinedload`, `selectinload` to manage relationship loading and avoid N+1 query problems.
    *   Use `with_entities` to select specific columns if you don't need full ORM objects, which can be more efficient.
    *   Understand the difference between `filter()` and `filter_by()`. `filter()` is more flexible and allows for complex SQL expressions.
    *   Leverage SQLAlchemy's SQL Expression Language for complex queries rather than raw SQL where possible for better portability and integration with the ORM.

3.  **Transactions**:
    *   Understand SQLAlchemy's transaction semantics. By default, a session operates within a transaction that is committed with `db.commit()` or rolled back with `db.rollback()`.
    *   Group related database operations within a single transaction to ensure data consistency.

4.  **Model Definition**:
    *   Define clear relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) with appropriate `back_populates` or `backref` arguments.
    *   Use constraints (e.g., `CheckConstraint`, `UniqueConstraint`) at the database level to enforce data integrity.
    *   Consider using `alembic` for database schema migrations.

5.  **Performance**:
    *   Profile your database queries. Tools like SQLAlchemy's built-in logging or external profilers can help identify slow queries.
    *   Use database indexes appropriately on columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
    *   For bulk operations (inserts, updates), explore SQLAlchemy's bulk methods or Core expression language for better performance.

6.  **Asynchronous Operations (SQLAlchemy 1.4+ / 2.0)**:
    *   When working in an async environment (like FastAPI with `async def`), use SQLAlchemy's async support (e.g., `AsyncSession`, `AsyncEngine`) and `await` database calls.

7.  **Error Handling**:
    *   Handle SQLAlchemy exceptions gracefully (e.g., `IntegrityError`, `NoResultFound`).

8.  **Code Organization**:
    *   Separate your SQLAlchemy models, session management, and CRUD operations into distinct modules or layers (e.g., a repository pattern or service layer).

Following these practices will help you make the most of SQLAlchemy's powerful features while keeping your database interactions efficient and manageable.
