# Advanced SQLAlchemy Patterns

This section explores sophisticated patterns and techniques for leveraging SQLAlchemy in complex application architectures.

- [Multi-Tenant and Vendor-Based Architectures](./multi-tenancy.md): Learn how to implement multi-tenancy using SQLAlchemy, with approaches like schema-based or row-based data isolation.

These advanced patterns help in building scalable and maintainable database layers for demanding applications.

Beyond basic CRUD operations and model definitions, SQLAlchemy supports a variety of advanced patterns that can help solve complex data management problems. This section delves into some of these powerful techniques.

Topics include:

-   **Multi-Tenant Architectures**: Strategies for building applications that serve multiple tenants (customers/organizations) with varying degrees of data isolation, including shared schema with discriminators, schema-per-tenant, and database-per-tenant approaches.
-   **Polymorphic Loading**: Techniques for mapping class inheritance hierarchies to database tables (e.g., single table inheritance, joined table inheritance) and querying for objects of different types.
-   **Custom Types and Type Extensions**: Creating custom SQLAlchemy types to handle specific data formats or database-specific types not directly supported out-of-the-box.
-   **Event System Hooks**: Leveraging SQLAlchemy's event system to trigger custom logic at various points in the ORM lifecycle (e.g., before/after insert, update, delete, load).
-   **Versioned Objects / Audit Trails**: Implementing patterns to track changes to data over time, such as creating audit logs or maintaining historical versions of records.
-   **Working with Database-Specific Features**: Utilizing SQLAlchemy's dialects to interact with unique features of your chosen database system.

Understanding and applying these advanced patterns can significantly enhance the capabilities and robustness of your SQLAlchemy-backed applications.
