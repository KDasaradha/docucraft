# Pydantic with Static Type Checking

Leverage static type checkers to enhance the robustness of your Pydantic models and catch potential type errors before runtime.

- [Static Type Checking for Pydantic Models](./static-analysis.md): Understand how tools like Mypy or Pyright interact with Pydantic, common challenges, and how Pydantic plugins can improve the static analysis experience.

Combining Pydantic's runtime validation with static type checking leads to more reliable and maintainable Python code.
