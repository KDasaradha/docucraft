# OpenAPI Customization in FastAPI

FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema for your API, which powers the interactive documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc). This section covers how to customize this generated schema.

- [Customizing OpenAPI Schema](./customization.md): Learn techniques to add metadata, tags, examples, and other details to your OpenAPI documentation, making it more informative and user-friendly.

Tailoring your OpenAPI schema can significantly improve the developer experience for consumers of your API.
