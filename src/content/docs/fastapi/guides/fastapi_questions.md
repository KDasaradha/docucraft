# Introduction to APIs and FastAPI
## Understanding APIs

### What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It allows different software systems to communicate with each other.

### Types of APIs
- **RESTful**: Representational State Transfer, a lightweight and scalable web service.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data.
- **SOAP**: Simple Object Access Protocol, a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.
- **WebSockets**: A protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## What is REST API?

### Principles
- Statelessness
- Client-Server Architecture
- Cacheability
- Layered System
- Uniform Interface

### Advantages
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Performance

### Use cases
- Web services
- Mobile applications
- Microservices
