# Advanced FastAPI Features

This section delves into more advanced capabilities of FastAPI, enabling you to build sophisticated and robust web APIs.

- [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md): Understand how to use FastAPI's powerful dependency injection system for reusable logic, authentication, and more.
- [Background Tasks](./background-tasks.md): Learn to execute tasks after returning a response, improving API responsiveness for long operations.
- [WebSockets](./websockets.md): Implement real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and your server.
- [Custom Middleware](./custom-middleware.md): Create middleware to process requests and responses globally.
- [Event Handlers (Startup/Shutdown)](./event-handlers.md): Execute code during application startup or shutdown for initialization and cleanup.
- [Custom APIRouter](./custom-apirouter.md): Organize your routes into modular `APIRouter` instances for better code structure.
- [Request Context](./request-context.md): Access and manipulate low-level request data.

These features, when used effectively, allow for building complex, maintainable, and high-performance applications with FastAPI.
