# Testing FastAPI Applications

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of your FastAPI applications.

- [Dependency Overrides for Testing](./dependency-overrides.md): Learn how to override dependencies in your tests, for example, to mock database connections or external services, making your tests more isolated and predictable.
- [Testing FastAPI Applications (Overview)](./../deployment-and-testing/testing-fastapi.md): A general guide to testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests with `TestClient`.

Robust testing practices lead to more stable and maintainable FastAPI codebases.
