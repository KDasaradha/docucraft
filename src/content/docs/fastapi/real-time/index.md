# Real-Time Features in FastAPI

FastAPI supports building real-time applications that require persistent connections and server-to-client data pushing.

- [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](./server-sent-events.md): Implement one-way real-time communication from the server to the client, ideal for live updates and notifications.
- [WebSockets](./../advanced-features/websockets.md): For bidirectional, full-duplex communication, often used in chat applications, live collaboration tools, and online gaming. (Link to existing WebSockets page)

Explore these features to add dynamic, real-time capabilities to your FastAPI applications.
