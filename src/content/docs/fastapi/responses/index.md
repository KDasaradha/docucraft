# Handling Responses in FastAPI

FastAPI offers flexible ways to control the data and format of HTTP responses sent back to the client.

- [Streaming Responses](./streaming-responses.md): Efficiently stream large amounts of data or real-time updates without loading everything into memory.
- [Custom Response Classes](./custom-response-classes.md): Create custom response classes for specialized output formats beyond standard JSON, like XML or custom binary types.

Mastering response handling allows you to tailor your API's output precisely to client needs and optimize for performance.
