# PostgreSQL - Intermediate Concepts

Key topics for intermediate PostgreSQL include:

- Advanced SELECT Queries:
    - `GROUP BY` and Aggregate Functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
    - `HAVING` clause
    - Joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`)
    - Subqueries (in SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses)
    - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH`
    - Set Operations (`UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)
- Indexes: Types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, GIN), creating and managing indexes, understanding their impact on performance
- Views: Creating and using views
- Transactions: ACID properties, `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, Savepoints
- Functions and Stored Procedures (using PL/pgSQL basics)
- Triggers
- Data Import and Export (`COPY` command, psql utilities)
- Basic Database Administration: Backups, restores, user management
