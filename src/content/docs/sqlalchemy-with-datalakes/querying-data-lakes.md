title: SQLAlchemy with Data Lakes

# SQLAlchemy with Data Lakes (e.g., Trino/Presto, Dremio)

**Original Description**: Using SQLAlchemy with query engines like Trino (formerly PrestoSQL) or Dremio to query data lakes.

While SQLAlchemy is primarily known for its interaction with traditional relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), its Core SQL Expression Language is flexible enough to be used with SQL query engines that operate on top of data lakes (like Trino, Presto, Dremio, Apache Spark SQL via Thrift Server, etc.).

Data lakes store vast amounts of raw data in various formats (Parquet, ORC, CSV, JSON) on distributed file systems (like S3, HDFS, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage). Query engines provide a SQL interface to query this data in place.

**How it Works:**

1.  **SQLAlchemy Dialect**: You need a specific SQLAlchemy dialect for the query engine you want to use. These dialects translate SQLAlchemy Core expressions into the SQL dialect understood by the target engine.
    *   **Trino/Presto**: `sqlalchemy-trino` ([https://github.com/trinodb/sqlalchemy-trino](https://github.com/trinodb/sqlalchemy-trino)) or `pyhive` (can sometimes work with Presto/Trino with `presto` scheme).
    *   **Dremio**: `sqlalchemy-dremio` ([https://github.com/dremio-hub/sqlalchemy-dremio](https://github.com/dremio-hub/sqlalchemy-dremio)) or Dremio's ODBC/JDBC drivers via `pyodbc` or `jaydebeapi` if a direct dialect isn't fully featured.
    *   **Apache Spark SQL (Thrift Server)**: `pyhive` with `hive` scheme can connect to Spark Thrift Server.
    *   **Databricks**: `databricks-sql-connector` provides a Python connector and often a SQLAlchemy dialect or integration.

2.  **Connection String**: You'll use a connection string specific to the dialect and query engine, pointing to the engine's coordinator or endpoint.

3.  **SQLAlchemy Core**: You primarily use SQLAlchemy Core's SQL Expression Language to build queries. The ORM's full capabilities (like unit of work, identity map, rich relationship loading) might be limited or not applicable because data lake query engines are often optimized for analytical, read-heavy workloads and may not support transactions or DML in the same way as traditional RDBMS.

4.  **Schema Definition/Reflection**:
    *   Data lake tables (or views/datasets in Dremio) are often defined in the query engine's catalog (e.g., Hive Metastore for Trino/Presto, Dremio's data sources).
    *   You can use SQLAlchemy's reflection capabilities (`Table('my_table', metadata, autoload_with=engine)`) to introspect the schema if the dialect supports it.
    *   Alternatively, you can define `Table` objects manually in SQLAlchemy Core if you know the schema.

**Example: Querying Trino with `sqlalchemy-trino`**

1.  **Install Dialect**: `pip install sqlalchemy sqlalchemy-trino`
2.  **Setup**: Ensure TrinoDB is running and accessible. Ensure you have a catalog (e.g., `hive`) configured in Trino that points to your data lake storage (e.g., S3 with Parquet files).

    ```python
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text, select, Table, Column, MetaData, String, Integer
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session # Session can be used for Core execution too

    # --- Connection ---
    # Adjust connection string for your Trino setup (user, host, port, catalog, schema)
    # Example: connecting to Trino coordinator, using 'hive' catalog and 'default' schema
    # Password might be needed depending on Trino auth config.
    TRINO_CONNECTION_STRING = "trino://user@trino-coordinator-host:8080/hive/default"
    # For Trino with TLS/HTTPS: trinos://...
    # For Trino with Kerberos or other auth, check sqlalchemy-trino docs.

    try:
        engine = create_engine(TRINO_CONNECTION_STRING)
        print("Successfully created Trino engine.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating Trino engine: {e}")
        exit()

    # --- Option 1: Raw SQL (Simple way to test connection) ---
    print("\n--- Querying with Raw SQL ---")
    try:
        with engine.connect() as connection:
            # Assuming a table 'my_parquet_table' exists in hive.default
            # This table would be backed by Parquet files in your data lake (e.g., S3)
            # And Trino's Hive connector is configured to see it.
            result = connection.execute(text("SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_parquet_table LIMIT 5"))
            for row in result:
                print(row)
            connection.commit() # Usually not needed for SELECTs in Trino but good practice
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing raw SQL query on Trino: {e}")


    # --- Option 2: SQLAlchemy Core SQL Expression Language ---
    print("\n--- Querying with SQLAlchemy Core ---")
    metadata = MetaData()

    # Define or reflect the table structure
    # If reflecting:
    # my_parquet_table_reflected = Table('my_parquet_table', metadata, autoload_with=engine)
    # Or define manually if reflection isn't perfect or desired:
    my_parquet_table = Table(
        'my_parquet_table', metadata,
        Column('col1', String), # Adjust types based on your actual table schema in Trino
        Column('col2', Integer),
        Column('date_col', String) # Example
        # ... other columns
    )

    stmt = select(my_parquet_table.c.col1, my_parquet_table.c.col2) \
        .where(my_parquet_table.c.date_col == '2023-10-01') \
        .limit(10)

    try:
        with Session(engine) as session: # Can use Session for Core execution context
            results = session.execute(stmt).fetchall()
            print(f"Found {len(results)} rows using SQLAlchemy Core:")
            for row in results:
                print(f"Col1: {row.col1}, Col2: {row.col2}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing SQLAlchemy Core query on Trino: {e}")

    # --- Considerations for ORM ---
    # While you can map ORM classes to tables queried via Trino,
    # features like relationship loading, unit of work (inserts/updates/deletes directly via ORM objects)
    # might not work as expected or be efficient, as Trino is primarily a query engine.
    # Reads are generally fine. Writes might need to go through Trino's DML or underlying systems.
    # class MyParquetData(Base): # Assuming Base = declarative_base()
    #     __table__ = my_parquet_table # Map to the manually defined/reflected table
    #
    # try:
    #    with Session(engine) as session:
    #        orm_results = session.query(MyParquetData).filter(MyParquetData.date_col == '2023-10-01').limit(5).all()
    #        for item in orm_results:
    #            print(f"ORM Object: col1={item.col1}")
    # except Exception as e:
    #     print(f"Error with ORM query: {e}")
    ```

**Benefits of Using SQLAlchemy with Data Lake Query Engines:**

*   **Pythonic SQL Construction**: Build complex analytical queries using Python's expressiveness and SQLAlchemy Core's composable constructs.
*   **Abstraction**: The dialect handles some of the engine-specific SQL syntax.
*   **Integration**: Allows integrating data lake queries into existing Python applications or data pipelines that already use SQLAlchemy.
*   **Tooling**: Potentially leverage other SQLAlchemy-ecosystem tools (though full compatibility, e.g., with Alembic for data lake "migrations," is unlikely).

**Limitations and Considerations:**

*   **Read-Heavy Focus**: These integrations are primarily for querying (SELECT). DML support (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on data lakes via engines like Trino is often limited, experimental, or has different semantics than in an RDBMS. Data ingestion into data lakes usually happens through other means (ETL tools, Spark jobs, direct writes to S3).
*   **ORM Functionality**: Full SQLAlchemy ORM features (unit of work, identity map, lazy loading of relationships) might not be fully supported or practical. Using SQLAlchemy Core is generally more straightforward and recommended for data lake querying.
*   **Transactionality**: Distributed query engines over data lakes often don't support ACID transactions in the same way traditional databases do.
*   **Performance**: Query performance depends heavily on the underlying data lake storage format (Parquet, ORC are optimized for analytical queries), data layout (partitioning, bucketing), the query engine's capabilities, and the efficiency of the generated SQL.
*   **Dialect Maturity**: SQLAlchemy dialects for data lake engines might be less mature or feature-complete than those for established RDBMS. Always check the dialect's documentation.

In summary, SQLAlchemy Core provides a valuable Pythonic interface for constructing SQL queries against data lakes via engines like Trino or Dremio, primarily for analytical and read-heavy workloads. It enables Python developers to leverage their SQLAlchemy skills to access and analyze big data.
