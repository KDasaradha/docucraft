# DocuCraft Blueprint

This document outlines the architectural vision, design principles, and technical specifications that guide DocuCraft's development. It serves as both a reference for contributors and an insight into our design thinking.

## Core Features

### Content Management

- **Markdown Rendering**: Transform Markdown files into clean, readable documentation with support for GitHub-Flavored Markdown syntax.
- **Code Highlighting**: Integrate Prism.js or Shiki for beautiful, accurate syntax highlighting across numerous programming languages.
- **Asset Management**: Seamlessly handle images, diagrams, and other media within documentation.

### User Experience

- **Navigation System**: Implement a customizable, responsive navigation based on the structure of Markdown files, with automatic generation of table of contents.
- **Theming Engine**: Support light/dark themes with customizable color schemes to match your brand identity.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal viewing experience across devices from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

### Functionality

- **Intelligent Search**: Integrate a powerful search tool with fuzzy matching to quickly find content within the documentation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting, image optimization, and other techniques to ensure fast load times.
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG compliance for an inclusive documentation experience.

## Design System

### Color Palette

- **Primary Background**: White (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#F9FAFB) to maximize readability
- **Secondary Background**: Light gray (#F3F4F6) for subtle section differentiation
- **Primary Text**: Dark gray (#1F2937) for optimal contrast and readability
- **Secondary Text**: Medium gray (#6B7280) for less emphasized content
- **Accent Color**: Teal (#008080) for links, buttons, and interactive elements
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) for positive feedback
- **Warning**: Amber (#F59E0B) for cautionary messages
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) for critical alerts

### Typography

- **Body Text**: Inter or system-ui, a clean sans-serif font optimized for screen readability
- **Headings**: Slightly heavier weight of the same font family for visual hierarchy
- **Code**: Monospace font (JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) for code blocks and inline code
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Base: 16px (1rem)
  - Scale: 1.25 ratio for harmonious size progression

### Layout Principles

- **Whitespace**: Generous spacing between elements to reduce visual clutter
- **Grid System**: Consistent 12-column grid for layout structure
- **Content Width**: Maximum width of 65-70 characters per line for optimal readability
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different levels of information

### Component Design

- **Navigation**: Collapsible sidebar with nested sections and visual indicators for current page
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighting with copy button and optional line numbers
- **Callouts**: Styled blocks for notes, warnings, tips, and important information
- **Tables**: Clean, bordered design with alternating row colors for better readability

## Animation Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Animations should enhance usability, not distract
- **Duration**: Quick (150-300ms) for most interactions
- **Easing**: Ease-out for entering elements, ease-in for exiting elements
- **Triggers**: Hover, focus, and state changes should have appropriate visual feedback

This blueprint serves as a living document that will evolve alongside DocuCraft. Contributors are encouraged to propose improvements while maintaining alignment with the core design philosophy.
