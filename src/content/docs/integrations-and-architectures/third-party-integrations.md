# Third-Party Integrations with FastAPI

**Original Description**: Integrating FastAPI with other services and tools like Celery for background tasks, Kafka for message queues, and external APIs.

FastAPI's flexibility and Python's rich ecosystem make it well-suited for integrating with a wide variety of third-party services and tools. These integrations can enhance functionality, scalability, and resilience.

**1. Celery for Background Tasks:**

*   **Use Case**: Offloading long-running, resource-intensive, or deferrable tasks from the main request-response cycle to improve API responsiveness. Examples: sending emails, processing images/videos, generating reports, calling slow external services.
*   **Celery Overview**: A distributed task queue system. It allows you to define tasks (Python functions) that can be executed asynchronously by separate worker processes, potentially on different machines. It requires a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis) to manage the queue of tasks.
*   **Integration Steps**:
    1.  **Install Celery and a broker client**: `pip install celery redis` (if using Redis as broker).
    2.  **Configure Celery**: Set up a Celery application instance, defining the broker URL and backend (for storing results, optional).
        ```python
        # tasks.py (or your Celery app file)
        from celery import Celery

        # CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
        # CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
        # Use environment variables for these in production

        celery_app = Celery(
            'tasks', 
            broker=os.environ.get('CELERY_BROKER_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0'),
            backend=os.environ.get('CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')
        )

        # Optional Celery configuration
        celery_app.conf.update(
            task_serializer='json',
            accept_content=['json'],  # Ensure Celery uses JSON
            result_serializer='json',
            timezone='UTC',
            enable_utc=True,
        )

        @celery_app.task
        def send_confirmation_email(user_email: str, content: str):
            print(f"Simulating sending email to {user_email} with content: '{content}'")
            # In a real app, use smtplib or an email service library
            import time
            time.sleep(5) # Simulate a slow email sending process
            print(f"Email to {user_email} sent.")
            return f"Email successfully sent to {user_email}"
        ```
    3.  **Trigger Tasks from FastAPI**: In your FastAPI endpoints, call the `.delay()` or `.apply_async()` method on your Celery tasks.
        ```python
        # main.py (FastAPI app)
        from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks # BackgroundTasks for simple, in-process tasks
        # from .tasks import send_confirmation_email # Import your Celery task

        app = FastAPI()

        @app.post("/register-user/")
        async def register_user(email: str):
            # ... user registration logic ...
            
            # Trigger Celery task
            task_result = send_confirmation_email.delay(email, "Welcome to our service!")
            print(f"Celery task {task_result.id} for email to {email} has been queued.")
            
            return {"message": "User registered, confirmation email will be sent."}
        ```
    4.  **Run Celery Workers**: Start Celery worker processes separately: `celery -A tasks worker -l info` (assuming your Celery app instance is in `tasks.py`).
*   **Benefits**: Decouples tasks, improves API responsiveness, allows for retries and more robust task management.
*   **Note**: FastAPI's built-in `BackgroundTasks` is simpler for tasks that can run within the same process and don't need persistence, distributed execution, or advanced queueing features. Celery is for more complex, distributed background processing.

**2. Kafka (or RabbitMQ) for Message Queues:**

*   **Use Case**: Asynchronous communication between microservices, event-driven architectures, handling high-throughput data streams, decoupling services for resilience.
*   **Kafka/RabbitMQ Overview**:
    *   **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform, often used for high-throughput, fault-tolerant message queuing and event streaming.
    *   **RabbitMQ**: A robust, general-purpose message broker implementing protocols like AMQP.
*   **Integration Steps (Conceptual - using a Python Kafka client like `kafka-python` or `confluent-kafka-python`)**:
    1.  **Install Client Library**: `pip install kafka-python` or `pip install confluent-kafka-python`.
    2.  **Producer in FastAPI**: When an event occurs (e.g., a new order is created), a FastAPI endpoint can act as a producer, sending a message to a Kafka topic.
        ```python
        # main.py (FastAPI app)
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        from kafka import KafkaProducer # Example using kafka-python
        import json
        import os

        app = FastAPI()

        # KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'localhost:9092' # Use env var
        producer = None

        @app.on_event("startup")
        async def startup_event():
            global producer
            try:
                producer = KafkaProducer(
                    bootstrap_servers=os.environ.get('KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS', 'localhost:9092'),
                    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
                )
                print("KafkaProducer connected.")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to connect KafkaProducer: {e}")
                producer = None # Ensure producer is None if connection fails

        @app.on_event("shutdown")
        async def shutdown_event():
            if producer:
                producer.close()
                print("KafkaProducer closed.")

        @app.post("/orders/")
        async def create_order(order_data: dict): # Assume order_data is a Pydantic model
            # ... save order to DB ...
            if producer:
                try:
                    producer.send("order_events", {"event_type": "ORDER_CREATED", "order": order_data})
                    producer.flush() # Ensure message is sent
                    print(f"Order event sent to Kafka topic 'order_events'")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Failed to send order event to Kafka: {e}")
                    # Handle Kafka send failure (e.g., log, retry mechanism, or alert)
            else:
                print("Kafka producer not available. Order event not sent.")

            return {"message": "Order created and event published (if Kafka available)."}
        ```
    3.  **Consumer Services**: Separate services (which could also be FastAPI apps or other Python scripts) act as consumers, subscribing to Kafka topics and processing messages.
*   **Benefits**: Decoupling of services, improved fault tolerance (if a consumer is down, messages queue up), scalability (multiple consumers can process messages in parallel), event-driven architecture.

**3. Integrating with External APIs:**

*   **Use Case**: Fetching data from third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, weather APIs, social media APIs), or communicating with other internal microservices.
*   **Integration Steps**:
    1.  **Use an HTTP Client**: `httpx` is highly recommended for FastAPI due to its async capabilities and modern API. The built-in `requests` library is synchronous and would block the event loop if used directly in `async def` endpoints (use `fastapi.concurrency.run_in_threadpool` if you must use `requests`).
    2.  **Async Calls**: Make `await`ed calls to external APIs within your `async def` endpoints or dependencies.
        ```python
        # main.py
        import httpx
        from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

        app = FastAPI()
        
        OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY") # Store securely
        OPEN_WEATHER_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

        @app.get("/weather/{city}")
        async def get_weather(city: str):
            if not OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Weather service API key not configured.")

            params = {"q": city, "appid": OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY, "units": "metric"}
            
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                try:
                    print(f"Fetching weather for {city}...")
                    response = await client.get(OPEN_WEATHER_URL, params=params)
                    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for 4xx/5xx status codes
                    weather_data = response.json()
                    return weather_data
                except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:
                    # Log the error and return a more user-friendly message
                    print(f"HTTPStatusError from weather API: {exc.response.status_code} - {exc.response.text}")
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=exc.response.status_code,
                        detail=f"Error fetching weather data from provider: {exc.response.json().get('message', 'Unknown error')}"
                    )
                except httpx.RequestError as exc:
                    # Handle network errors, timeouts etc.
                    print(f"RequestError fetching weather: {exc}")
                    raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail=f"Could not connect to weather service: {exc}")
        ```
    3.  **Error Handling & Retries**: Implement robust error handling (as shown above) for API failures, timeouts, and unexpected responses. Consider retry mechanisms (e.g., using libraries like `tenacity`) for transient errors.
    4.  **API Keys & Authentication**: Securely manage API keys and authentication details for external services, typically using environment variables and Pydantic settings models.
    5.  **Data Mapping (Pydantic)**: Use Pydantic models to validate and structure the data received from external APIs.

**4. Other Integrations:**

*   **Databases**: Covered extensively with SQLAlchemy.
*   **Caching Systems (Redis, Memcached)**: Use for response caching, function caching, or as a broker/backend for Celery. Libraries like `redis-py` (with its async version `redis.asyncio`) or `aiomcache`.
*   **Monitoring and Logging Tools (Datadog, Sentry, Prometheus, ELK Stack)**: Integrate clients or configure logging to send data to these platforms for observability.
*   **Authentication Providers (Auth0, Keycloak, Firebase Auth)**: Integrate with OAuth2/OpenID Connect flows.

When integrating with any third-party service, always prioritize asynchronous communication if your FastAPI app is async, handle errors gracefully, secure credentials, and consider aspects like rate limits and data consistency.
