# Next.js - Advanced Topics

Key topics for advanced Next.js include:

- Advanced App Router Patterns:
    - Conditional rendering of layouts
    - Advanced caching strategies with `fetch` (cache tags, revalidation)
    - Partial Prerendering (experimental)
- Performance Optimization:
    - Analyzing bundle sizes (e.g., `@next/bundle-analyzer`)
    - Dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for code splitting
    - Optimizing Server Component rendering
- Authentication and Authorization strategies
- Testing Next.js applications (unit, integration, e2e)
- Customizing Babel and Webpack (if needed, less common with App Router)
- Draft Mode (Preview Mode) for headless CMS integration
- Edge Functions and Edge Middleware
- Advanced Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- Working with Monorepos
- Deployment and Hosting strategies for Next.js (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker)
